## What's Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with three or more hidden layers. It is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize stop signs and distinguish pedestrians from lampposts.

The term "deep" in deep learning refers to the depth of the neural network model, which refers to the number of layers contributing to the model's understanding of the data. Modern deep learning models often consist of tens or even hundreds of successive layers of representations. It is worth noting that the foundational concepts of deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks and backpropagation, were already well understood as early as 1989.

Deep learning has achieved remarkable advancements in various domains, including:

- Near-human-level classification
- Near-human-level speech recognition
- Near-human-level handwriting recognition
- Improved machine translation
- Superhuman Go playing
- And much more...

Deep learning has demonstrated its potential to surpass human-level performance in several tasks, showcasing its ability to learn complex patterns and extract valuable insights from large datasets.
