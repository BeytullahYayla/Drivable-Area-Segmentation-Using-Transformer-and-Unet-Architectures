## What's Machine Learning
Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. In machine learning, we provide input data and output data and our machine learning model learns specific rules and patterns with the help of statistical methods and algorithms. So when we face new or unseen input data by the model before, our machine learning model can easily predict output data. In this way, we can do many tasks that will make our life easier. We can use machine learning in our projects. Perhaps you would like to give your homemade robot a brain of its own.? Make it recognize faces? Or learn to walk around? Or your company has tons of data. So you may want to segment customers and find the best marketing strategy for each group, recommend products for each client based on what similar clients bought, forecast next yearâ€™s revenue, and more.
