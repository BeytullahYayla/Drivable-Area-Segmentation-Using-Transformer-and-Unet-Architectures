## Supervised Learning And Unsupervised Learning

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. In supervised learning, we use accurate labels (desired solutions) from our data to train our model.

Supervised learning can be divided into two types of problems: classification and regression.

**Classification** uses algorithms to accurately assign test data into specific categories.

**Regression** is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is commonly used for making projections, such as sales revenue for a business.

Here are some popular supervised learning algorithms:

- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, we do not have labeled data. The system tries to learn specific patterns in the data without a teacher.

Here are some commonly used unsupervised machine learning algorithms:

**Clustering**
- K-Means
- DBSCAN
- Hierarchical Cluster Analysis

**Anomaly Detection and Novelty Detection**
- One-class SVM
- Isolation Forest

**Visualization and Dimensionality Reduction**
- Principal Component Analysis
- Kernel PCA
- Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
- t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
